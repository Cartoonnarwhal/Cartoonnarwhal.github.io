H-H-H...Here we go! 
So they're finally here, performing for you 
If you know the words, you can join in too 
Put your hands together if you want to clap 
As we take you through this fun-ky rap!  HUH! 
  
D. K.!  Donkey Kong! 
  
* He's the leader of the bunch.  You know him well. 
He's finally back to kick some tail! 

His coconut gun can fire in spurts 
If he shoots ya,  it's gonna hurt! (2) 
He's bigger!  faster!  and stronger too! 
He's the first member of the DK crew! 
D. K.!  Donkey Kong!  HEY! 
D. K.!  Donkey Kong is here! 

This Kong's got style, so listen up dudes! 
She shrinks in size to suit her mood! 

She's quick n' nimble when she needs to be 
She floats in air and climbs up trees! 

If you choose her, you won't choose wrong 
With 
D. K.!  Donkey Kong! a skip and a hop, she's ONE COOL KONG! 

  
He has no style, he has no grace 
This Kong...has a funny face 
He can handstand when he wants to 
And stretch his arms out just for you! 

In-flate himself just like a balloon 
This cra-zy Kong just digs this tune!  HEY! 
D. K.! (D. K.!) Donkey Kong! 
D. K.! (D. K.!) Donkey Kong is here! 

He's back again, and about time, too 
And this time, he's in the mood! 

He can fly real high 
with his jetpack on... 
With his pistols out, he's one tough Kong! 
He can make you smile when you hear his tune... 
 
But, Kremlings beware 
'cause he's out after you! 
D. K.!  Donkey Kong! 
D. K.!  Donkey Kong! 
(fading) 
D. K.!  Donkey Kong! 
D. K.... 
  
Fi-nal-ly, he's here for you! 
It's the LAST member of the D. K. crew! 
This Kong's...so strong, it isn't funny! 
Can make a Kremling cry out for Mummy! 
 
He can pick up a boulder with relative ease 
Makes crushing rocks seem such a breeze 
He may move slow; he can't jump high 
But this Kong's one heck of a guy!  Hehehe... 

Come on Cranky! 
Take it to the stage! 
  
** Walnuts, peanuts, pineapple smells! 
Grapes, melons, oranges, and coconut shells! 
** REPEAT 
Oh, yeah!
